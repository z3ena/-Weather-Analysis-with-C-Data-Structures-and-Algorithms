Features
Data Structures:

Vectors: Used for dynamic array management and flexible data storage.
Binary Search Tree (BST): Implemented for efficient data retrieval and management.
Maps: Utilized for associative arrays and quick lookups.
Weather Data Analysis:

Data Collection: Functions to collect weather data such as temperature, wind speed, and other relevant metrics.
Statistics Calculation: Methods to calculate various statistics like average, minimum, and maximum values.
Data Display: Functions to present the collected data and calculated statistics in a readable format.
Modular Design:

Each program is structured with clear, modular code, making it easy to understand, extend, and maintain.
Separation of concerns is maintained with distinct modules for data collection, processing, and presentation.

The first Project utilizes an Encapsulated Vector wrapped in my class as the primary data structure for loading data and processing it.
The second one is the modified logic with more options to process the data and utilizes a BST, Vector and Map
